# Privacy-Preserving Model Interaction

This repository accompanies our research on privacy-preserving model interaction.

While the full interaction system described in the paper will be released later, we have open-sourced the **encrypted vector database** as the first component.

It enables secure vector storage and similarity search over encrypted vectors, forming the foundation of our privacy-preserving framework.

Additional components will be released in the future.
