# Privacy-Preserving Model Interaction

This repository accompanies our paper:

**["PPMI: Privacy-Preserving LLM Interaction with Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Databases"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17336)**  

While the full interaction system described in the paper will be released later, we have open-sourced the **encrypted vector database** as the first component. It enables secure vector storage and similarity search over encrypted vectors, forming the foundation of our privacy-preserving framework. Additional components will be released in the future.
